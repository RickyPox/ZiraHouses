The place is extremely calm. And within 10 minutes you're at a spectacular beach (Vitoria). Another hint: Vale Furado beach (OMG!) and the Nomade pizza bar on the cliffs.",

        comment: "We stayed for a week at Marina's charming house: before arriving Marina had taken the time to send us recommendations on our stay and best organized our arrival. We thank her so much for thinking about providing us with all the essentials for our baby. The house is spacious and perfectly equipped. The village is quiet and well located for visiting many sites.",
